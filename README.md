# Genomic Evolution Simulator Alpha

## Overview

Genomic Evolution Simulator Alpha is a lightweight Python project simulating the evolution of DNA sequences toward a target genome using principles of mutation and natural selection. Designed for educational and research purposes in computational genetics and biotechnology, this project models key evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation, fitness-based selection, and survival of the fittest.

## Features

- Generates an initial population of random DNA sequences
- Calculates fitness by measuring similarity to a target DNA sequence
- Applies mutations with adjustable rates per generation
- Selects top-performing sequences to reproduce in each generation
- Evolves the population over multiple generations until the target is reached or a limit is hit
- Prints progress with best sequence and fitness each generation
- Runs efficiently in any Python 3 environment, including online compilers

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Modify the target DNA sequence and parameters in the main script if desired.
3. Run the simulation using Python 3 interpreter.
4. Observe the evolutionary progress printed in the console.
